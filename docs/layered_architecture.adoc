== How to use


=== Layer 1: Cypher

You work directly on `cypher` queries. +
Sample code is in link:[examples/cypher-client].

=== Layer 2: Entity and Relation Stores

1. You create `Entity` and `Relation` Kotlin classes.
2. Then use these classes to define schema using `EntityType` and `RelationType`.
3. Then use these type classes to get their corresponding `EntityStore` and `RelationStore`.

You then work on *stores* - `EntityStore` and `RelationStore` to perform CRUD operations. +
Sample code is in link:[examples/store-client].

=== Layer 3: DSL

NOTE: First three setups are from <<Layer 2: Entity and Relation Stores>>.

1. You create `Entity` and `Relation` Kotlin classes.
2. Then use these classes to define schema using `EntityType` and `RelationType`.
3. Then use these type classes to get their corresponding `EntityStore` and `RelationStore`.
4. Create DSL using Kotlin's language features such as `Kotlin DSL`, `extension function`, `infix` etc.

You then work on DSL to perform CRUD operations. +
Sample code is in link:[examples/dsl-client].

=== Layer 3: Auto-generated DSL

1. You create `Entity` Kotlin classes.
2. Add `@Entity` and `@Relation` annotations on the Entity classes.
3. Use `dsl-annotation-processor` to generate auto-generate DSL.

You then work on DSL to perform CRUD operations. +
Sample code is in link:[examples/dsl-kapt-client].
