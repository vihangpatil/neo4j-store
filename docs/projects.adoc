== neo4j-store

=== Common Utils

==== common

General utilities used internally.

'''

=== model

`interface HasID` which is to be inherited by Entity classes, which are Kotlin Data classes.

'''

=== Layer 1 : Raw Cypher queries

==== client

Neo4jClient and Config classes used in setup at startup.

==== error

Hierarchy of `class StoreError` used for the error case.

==== transaction

Extend Neo4j transaction with custom rollback actions.

'''

=== Layer 2 : Entity and Relation Stores

==== schema

Has implementation of `*EntityType*`, `*EntityStore*`, `*RelationType*` and `*RelationStore*`. +
Any _Kotlin data class_ can be used to define `EntityType`.
`EntityType` is then used by `EntityStore`. +
`_FROM_` and `_TO_` `EntityType` along with `Relation` is used to define `RelationType`. +
`RelationType` is then used by `RelationStore`.

==== schema-model

Has classes needed to define `*Relation*`, which is then used in `RelationType`.

'''

=== Layer 3 : DSL

==== dsl-model-annotation

Has `*Entity*` and `*Relation*` annotations to be used on Kotlin data class to define Entities and Relations. +
This library is needed as `compileOnly` dependencies since these annotations are absent at runtime.

==== dsl-annotation-processor

This is Koltin Annotation processor library which auto-generates code containing Entity-Relation specific DSL functions.

==== dsl-model

Contains DSL grammar context classes which are used by `dsl` project. +
Needed only if you want to write DSL instead of auto-generating using _kapt_.

==== dsl

Internally uses `*schema*` project and abstracts (hides complexity) behind a convenient DSL. +
It has generic DSL functions. +
Developer then uses these generic DSL functions along with Entity-Relation specific DSL functions to perform Neo4j DB operations.

[NOTE]
====
You may also choose to write your own DSL instead of using auto-generated one. +
In that case, you do not need `dsl-model-annotation` and `dsl-annotation-processor` projects.

== Examples

=== cypher-client

Client working at cypher query level.

=== store-client

Client working at Entity and Relation Store level.

=== dsl-client and dsl-kapt-client

Client working at DSL level.
