Layered architecture exposing multiple levels of API.
Recommended top-level DSL API enables you to perform DB operations in *declarative type-safe semantics specific to your domain*.
Based on the _verbs_ used in your _Entity-Relation_ definitions (see <<Define Entities and Relations>>),
custom DSL is auto-generated with semantic verbs as method names.

== Quick Start

In this example, we have ...

1. Two entities - `(User)` and `(Role)`
2. Directed relation _from User to Role_ - `(User)-[HAS_ROLE]->(Role)`.

First you have to <<Define Entities and Relations>>. +
Based on those definitions, custom DSL methods will be auto-generated for you.

Then you can do operations on *_Entities_* such as ...

[source,kotlin]
----

// create
create { User(id = "foo", name = "Jane Doe") }

// read
val user = get( User withId "foo" )

// update
update { User(id = "foo", name = "John Doe") }

// delete
delete { User withId "foo" }
----

And operations on _Entity **Relations**_ such as

[source,kotlin]
----
// create
link { (User withId "foo") hasRole (Role withId "admin") }

// read
val user = get( User withRole (Role withId "admin"))
val role = get( Role ofUser (User withId "foo"))

// delete
unlink { (User withId "foo") hasRole (Role withId "admin") }
----

[NOTE]
====
* Here, methods such as `*withId*`, `*hasRole*`, `*withRole*` and `*ofUser*` will be provided by auto-generated code by Kotlin Symbol Processor (KSP).
* So, advanced users can also *write methods which are missing in auto-generated code*.
* But, generic methods such as `*create*`, `*get*`, `*update*`, `*delete*`, `*link*` and `*unlink*` are part of `dsl` and not auto-generated.

=== Define Entities and Relations

For e.g., to define...

 1. entities - `(User)` and `(Role)`
 2. relation `(User)-[HAS_ROLE]->(Role)`.

[source,kotlin]
----
package dev.vihang.neo4jstore.examples.dslclient

import dev.vihang.neo4jstore.schema.model.HasId
import dev.vihang.neo4jstore.dsl.model.annotation.Entity
import dev.vihang.neo4jstore.dsl.model.annotation.Relation

@Entity                             // <4>
@Relation(                          // <5>
        name = "HAS_ROLE",                                          // <6>
        to = "dev.vihang.neo4jstore.examples.dslclient.Role",       // <7>
        forwardRelation = "hasRole", // [User] hasRole [Role]       // <8>
        reverseRelation = "ofUser",  // [Role] ofUser [User]        // <8>
        forwardQuery = "withRole",   // get(User withRole [Role])   // <9>
        reverseQuery = "ofUser")     // get(Role ofUser [User])     // <9>
data class User(                    // <1>
        override val id: String,    // <2>
        val name: String
) : HasId {                         // <2>
    // Needed for DSL
    companion object                // <3>
}

@Entity                             // <4>
data class Role(                    // <1>
        override val id: String,    // <2>
        val description: String
) : HasId {                         // <2>
    // Needed for DSL
    companion object                // <3>
}
----
*To define an Entity (steps 1 to 4) and Relation (steps 5 onwards):*

<1> Create Entity class as simple Koltin `data class`. Name of the class will be used as label in Neo4j nodes.
<2> Make entity classes implement `interface HasId` and hence add a field `override val id: String`.
<3> Add `companion object` for entity classes. It is used to add extension functions such as `withId` for the DSL such
    as `get( User withId "foo" )`.
<4> Add `@Entity` annotation to the entity class.
<5> Only on *from* entity of a directed relation, add `@Relation` annotation. +
    In this example, the relation is *from* `User` entity.
<6> `*name*` of the relation has to be *capital snake case* (i.e., separated by underscore). It will be used as label in Neo4j relations.
<7> `*to*` of the relation is the *to* entity class's qualified name, i.e., including package name.
<8> `*forwardRelation*` and `*reverseRelation*` are _relation verbs_ in _camel case_ to define (create/link or delete/unlink) relation. +
    E.g. `User *hasRole* Role` and `Role *ofUser* User`. +
    Actual DSL code will be: +
    * `link { (User withId "foo") *hasRole* (Role withId "admin") }` +
    * `link { (Role withId "admin") *ofUser* (User withId "foo")}`
<9> `*forwardQuery*` and `*reverseQuery*` are _query verbs_, which are used in the query based on relations. +
    E.g. `get( User *withRole* Role)` and `get( Role *ofUser* User )` +
    Actual DSL code will be: +
    * `get( User *withRole* (Role withId "admin"))` +
    * `get( Role *ofUser* (User withId "foo"))`.

[NOTE]
====
* `withId` is reserved and cannot be used as "query" verbs.
* "relation" and "query" verbs can be same. +
  So, `ofUser` is both - `reverseRelation` and `reverseQuery` in the example above.
====

[TIP]
====
* For _relation verbs_, try using verbs which make sense as a _declaration_ or _statement_.
* For _query verbs_,, try using verbs which make sense as a _query_.
* And keep that _query_ and _statement_ as a documentation comment alongside.

== Source

This project was a module written by me named https://github.com/ostelco/ostelco-core/neo4j-store[neo4j-store] in a
larger Open-Source mono-repo project - https://github.com/ostelco/ostelco-core[ostelco-core] with
https://github.com/ostelco/ostelco-core/blob/develop/LICENSE[Apache License 2.0].
The module has been ported out to be project of its own so that it can be used independently.
The new project is made generic and does not take any code with business logic from its origin project.
